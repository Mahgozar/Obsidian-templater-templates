# the default template
the template i use for default in all of my notes unless i  wanna use something else for specific types. the template chooses tags based on a dictionary of phrases you define in  the template. it also asks you if this note is extracted from another note (if its a  child to another note) and if you choose use it asks you for that note  and adds a link to it with extracted-from:: behind it. this can be used  to define relationships in the breadcrumbs plugin
# the source note template
this is a template i use for loading pdfs and annotating  them using the annotator plugin. it also uses the breadcrumbs plugin to define any outgoing link from  this note as a child to this note. the template chooses tags based on a dictionary of phrases you define in  the template. the pdf should be in the attachments folder and it should have the same  name as the note i often use it to load single chapters from a book (i use this for large  >2000 page text books so loading individual chapters in individual  small <200 page pdfs is easier on the system)
# the daily note template
the daily note template links to 5 random notes each day  you create a daily note and also uses the dataview plugin to show you  the notes you've tagged as to_read i use this feature as a sort of read it later and to find and review  notes I've forgotten about it also uses the data view plugin to show the notes created that day and  the notes modified that day
# the rename template
a template that turns renames your active note and capitalizes the notes name
