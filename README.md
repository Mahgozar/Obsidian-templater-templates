# the default template
the template i use for default in all of my notes unless i  wanna use something else for specific types. the template chooses tags based on a dictionary of phrases you define in  the template. it also asks you if this note is extracted from another note (if its a  child to another note) and if you choose use it asks you for that note  and adds a link to it with extracted-from:: behind it. this can be used  to define relationships in the breadcrumbs plugin
# the source note template
- this is a template i use for loading pdfs and annotating them using the annotator plugin.
- it uses the breadcrumbs plugin to define any outgoing link from  this note as a child to this note.
- the template chooses tags based on a dictionary of phrases you define in  the template.
- the pdf should be in the attachments folder and it should have the same  name as the note. i often use it to load single chapters from a book (i use this for large  >2000 page text books so loading individual chapters in individual  small <200 page pdfs is easier on the system)
- the note is configured for web annotations in the annotator plugin
-   in these cases it will ask for the web page url automatically
-   if the note is a pdf extract from the uptodate website it is configured for the specific pdf format and retrieval of the article link
